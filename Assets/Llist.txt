Africa  - It's gonna take the lot to drag me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
I bless the rains down in Africa
Gonna take some time to do the things we never had

Friday I'm In Love- I don't care if Monday's blue
Tuesday's grey and Wednesday too
Thursday, I don't care about you
It's Friday, I'm in love
Monday, you can fall apart
Tuesday, Wednesday, break my heart
Thursday doesn't even start
It's Friday, I'm in love

Goodbye Mr A - Goodbye, Mr. A
You promised you would love us, but you knew too much
Goodbye, Mr. A
You had all the answers, but no human touch
If life is subtraction, your number is up
Your love is a fraction, it's not adding up

Thriller - It's close to midnight
And something evil's lurking in the dark
Under the moonlight
You see a sight that almost stops your heart
You try to scream
But terror takes the sound before you make it
You start to freeze
As horror looks you right between the eyes
You're paralyzed

Smooth - Man, it's a hot one
Like seven inches from the midday sun
I hear you whisper and the words melt everyone
But you stay so cool
My muñequita, my Spanish Harlem Mona Lisa
You're my reason for reason, the step in my groove

Unwritten - Staring at the blank page before you
Open up the dirty window
Let the sun illuminate the words that you cannot find
Reaching for something in the distance
So close you can almost taste it
Release your inhibitions

How To Save A Life - Some sort of window to your right
As he goes left and you stay right
Between the lines of fear and blame
You begin to wonder why you came

Uprising - Interchanging mind control
Come let the revolution take its toll
If you could flick a switch and open your third eye
You'd see that we should never be afraid to die
Rise up and take the power back
It's time the fat cats had a heart attack
You know that their time's coming to an end
We have to unify and watch our flag ascend

Ruby - Due to lack of interest
Tomorrow is cancelled
Let the clocks be reset
And the pendulums held
'Cause there's nothing at all
Except the space in between
Finding out what you're called
And repeating your name

Crocodile Rock - I remember when rock was young
Me and Susie had so much fun
Holding hands and skimming stones
Had an old gold Chevy and a place of my own
But the biggest kick I ever got
Was doing a thing called the Crocodile Rock
While the other kids were rocking 'round the clock
We were hopping and bopping to the Crocodile Rock

Castle On The Hill - I'm on my way
Driving at ninety down those country lanes
Singing to "Tiny Dancer"
And I miss the way you make me feel, and it's real
We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill

Maniac - Just a steel town girl on a Saturday night
Looking for the fight of her life
In the real time world, no one sees her at all
They all say she's crazy
Locking rhythms to the beat of her heart
Changing movement into light
She has danced into the danger zone
When the dancer becomes the dance

Take On Me - We're talking away
I don't know what I'm to say
I'll say it anyway
Today's another day to find you
Shying away
I'll be coming for your love, okay?

Take Me Out - So if you're lonely, you know I'm here waiting for you
I'm just a crosshair, I'm just a shot away from you
And if you leave here, you leave me broken, shattered I lie
I'm just a crosshair, I'm just a shot, then we can die

Everybody Wants To Rule The World - Welcome to your life
There's no turning back
Even while we sleep
We will find you
Acting on your best behaviour
Turn your back on Mother Nature
Everybody wants to rule the world

Don't Dream It's Over - There is freedom within, there is freedom without
Try to catch a deluge in a paper cup
There's a battle ahead, many battles are lost
But you'll never see the end of the road
While you're travelling with me

Bring Me To Life - How can you see into my eyes like open doors?
Leading you down into my core, where I've become so numb

Can We Fix It? - Bob the Builder!
Can we fix it?
Bob the Builder!
Yes, we can!
Scoop, Muck and Dizzy, and Roley too
Lofty and Wendy join the crew
Bob and the gang have so much fun
Working together, they get the job done

Blue - I have a blue house with a blue window
Blue is the color of all that I wear
Blue are the streets and all the trees are too
I have a girlfriend and she is so blue
Blue are the people here that walk around
Blue like my Corvette, it's sitting outside
Blue are the words I say and what I think
Blue are the feelings that live inside me

SexyBack - I'm bringin' sexy back
Them other boys don't know how to act
I think it's special, what's behind your back?
So turn around and I'll pick up the slack
Take it to the bridge, c'mon
Dirty babe
You see these shackles, baby, I'm your slave
I'll let you whip me if I misbehave
It's just that no one makes me feel this way

Earthquake - Ladies and gentlemen, this is something
They call a ground breaker
So, let me first apologize to the shirts and the ties
For your make up
Cause I'll make you ugly, as soon as it drops
We're on a rampage, bottles poppin' off
Before you know it, there's rubble and dust
Cause we'll be pushing it up
Somebody say 'You better run!'

Bonkers - I wake up everyday it's a daydream
Everything in my life ain't what it seems
I wake up just to go back to sleep
I act real shallow but I'm in too deep
And all I care about is sex and violence
A heavy bass line is my kind of silence
Everybody says that I gotta get a grip
But I let sanity give me the slip

Smells Like Teen Spirit - Load up on guns, bring your friends
It's fun to lose and to pretend
She's over bored and self assured
Oh no, I know a dirty word

Tainted Love - Sometimes I feel I've got to
Run away I've got to
Get away
From the pain you drive into the heart of me
The love we share
Seems to go nowhere
And I've lost my light
For I toss and turn I can't sleep at night

Common People - Rent a flat above a shop
And cut your hair and get a job
And smoke some fags and play some pool
Pretend you never went to school
But still you'll never get it right
'Cause when you're laid in bed at night
Watching roaches climb the wall
If you called your dad he could stop it all

Girls And Boys - Avoiding all work
'Cause there's none available
Like battery thinkers
Count your thoughts
On one, two, three, four, five fingers
Nothing is wasted
Only reproduced
You get nasty blisters
Du bist sehr schön
But we haven't been introduced

Heart Of Glass - Once I had a love and it was a gas
Soon turned out had a heart of glass
Seemed like the real thing, only to find
Mucho mistrust, love's gone behind
Lost inside, adorable illusion and I cannot hide
I'm the one you're using, please don't push me aside
We could've made it cruising, yeah

Starboy - House so empty, need a centerpiece
Twenty racks a table, cut from ebony
Cut that ivory into skinny pieces
Then she clean it with her face, man, I love my baby
You talking money, need a hearing aid
You talking about me, I don't see the shade
Switch up my style, I take any lane
I switch up my cup, I kill any pain

Clint Eastwood - Finally, someone let me out of my cage
Now, time for me is nothing, 'cause I'm counting no age
Nah, I couldn't be there, now you shouldn't be scared
I'm good at repairs, and I'm under each snare
Intangible, bet you didn't think, so I command you to
Panoramic view, look, I'll make it all manageable
Pick and choose, sit and lose, all you different crews
Chicks and dudes, who you think is really kicking tunes?

All Star - Somebody once told me the world is gonna roll me
I ain't the sharpest tool in the shed
She was looking kind of dumb with her finger and her thumb
In the shape of an "L" on her forehead

Believe - No matter how hard I try
You keep pushing me aside
And I can't break through
There's no talking to you
It's so sad that you're leaving
It takes time to believe it
But after all is said and done
You're gonna be the lonely one

Livin' La Vida Loca - She's into new sensations
New kicks in the candlelight
She's got a new addiction
For every day and night
She'll make you take your clothes off and go dancing in the rain
She'll make you live her crazy life, but she'll take away your pain
Like a bullet to your brain

Hardware Store - They've got Allen wrenches, gerbil feeders, toilet seats, electric heaters

Ruler Of Everything - Do you hear the flibbity jibbity jibber jabber
With an, "Oh my god I've got to get out of here or I'll have another
Word to sell, another story to tell
Another timepiece ringing the bell"?
Do you hear the clock stop when you reach the end?
No, you know it must be neverending, comprehend if you can
But when you try to pretend to understand
You resemble a fool, although you're only a man
So give it up and smile

Virtual Insanity - And I'm thinking, what a mess we're in
Hard to know where to begin
If I could slip the sickly ties of Earth that man has made
And now every mother can choose the colour
Of her child
That's not nature's way
Well, that's what they said yesterday
There's nothin' left to do but pray
I think it's time I found a new religion

Get Lucky - Like the legend of the phoenix
All ends with beginnings
What keeps the planet spinning
The force from the beginning
Look
We've come too far
To give up who we are
So let's raise the bar
And our cups to the stars

Seven Nation Army - I'm gonna fight 'em off
A seven nation army couldn't hold me back
They're gonna rip it off
Taking their time right behind my back
And I'm talking to myself at night
Because I can't forget
Back and forth through my mind
Behind a cigarette

September - Do you remember
The twenty first night of September?
Love was changing the minds of pretenders
While chasing the clouds away
Our hearts were ringing
In the key that our souls were singing
As we danced in the night, remember
How the stars stole the night away

Play That Funky Music - Now first it wasn't easy
Changing rock and roll and minds
Yeah, things were getting shaky
I thought I'd have to leave it behind
But now it's so much better, it's so much better
I'm funking out in every way
But I'll never lose that feeling, no, I won't
Of how I learned my lesson that day

Hey Ya - My baby don't mess around
Because she loves me so, and this I know for sure
But does she really wanna
But can't stand to see me walk out the door?
Don't try to fight the feeling
'Cause the thought alone is killing me right now
Thank God for Mom and Dad
For sticking two together 'cause we don't know how

Gimme Gimme Gimme - Half past twelve
And I'm watching the late show in my flat, all alone
How I hate to spend the evening on my own
Autumn winds
Blowing outside the window as I look around the room
And it makes me so depressed to see the gloom
There's not a soul out there
No one to hear my prayer

We Didn't Start The Fire - Joseph Stalin, Malenkov
Nasser and Prokofiev
Rockefeller, Campanella
Communist Bloc

Trouble in the Suez

Mr Blue Sky - The sun is shining in the sky
There ain't a cloud in sight
It's stopped raining, everybody's in the play
And don't you know it's a beautiful new day, hey
Running down the avenue
See how the sun shines brightly
In the city, on the streets where once was pity
Mr. Blue Sky is living here today, hey

There Must Be An Angel - No one on Earth could feel like this
I'm thrown and overblown with bliss
There must be an angel
Playing with my heart, yeah
I walk into an empty room
And suddenly my heart goes "boom"!
It's an orchestra of angels
And they're playing with my heart, yeah

Down Under - Buying bread from a man in Brussels
He was six foot four and full of muscle
I said, "Do you speaka my language?"
And he just smiled and gave me a vegemite sandwich
And he said
I come from a land down under
Where beer does flow and men chunder
Can't you hear, can't you hear the thunder?
You better run, you better take cover

Ocean Man - Ocean man, can you see through the wonder of amazement
At the Oberman?
Ocean man, the crust is elusive when it casts forth
To the childlike man
Ocean man, the sequence of a life form braised in the sand
Soaking up the thirst of the land

Rasputin - There lived a certain man in Russia long ago
He was big and strong, in his eyes a flaming glow
Most people look at him with terror and with fear
But to Moscow chicks, he was such a lovely dear
He could preach the Bible like a preacher
Full of ecstasy and fire
But he also was the kind of teacher
Women would desire

Enjoy The Silence - Words like violence break the silence
Come crashing in into my little world
Painful to me, pierce right through me
Can't you understand? Oh, my little girl
All I ever wanted
All I ever needed is here in my arms
Words are very unnecessary
They can only do harm

Little Dark Age - Picking through the cards, knowing what's nearby
The carvings on the face say they find it hard
And the engine's failed again, all limits of disguise
The humor's not the same, coming from denial

Safe And Sound - I could fill your cup
You know my river won't evaporate this world we still appreciate
You could be my luck
Even in a hurricane of frowns I know that we'll be safe and sound

Mr Brightside - Coming out of my cage and I've been doing just fine
Gotta, gotta be down because I want it all
It started out with a kiss, how did it end up like this?
It was only a kiss, it was only a kiss
Now I'm falling asleep and she's calling a cab
While he's having a smoke and she's taking a drag
Now they're going to bed, and my stomach is sick
And it's all in my head

Stayin' Alive - Well, you can tell by the way I use my walk
I'm a woman's man, no time to talk
Music loud and women warm
I've been kicked around since I was born
And now it's all right, it's okay
And you may look the other way
We can try to understand
The New York Times' effect on man

Never Gonna Give You Up - We're no strangers to love
You know the rules and so do I
A full commitment's what I'm thinking of
You wouldn't get this from any other guy
I just wanna tell you how I'm feeling
Gotta make you understand

Eye Of The Tiger - Rising up, back on the street
Did my time, took my chances
Went the distance, now I'm back on my feet
Just a man and his will to survive
So many times, it happens too fast
You trade your passion for glory
Don't lose your grip on the dreams of the past
You must fight just to keep them alive

Roundabout - In and around the lake
Mountains come out of the sky and they stand there
One mile over we'll be there and we'll see you
Ten true summers we'll be there and laughing too
Twenty four before my love you'll see
I'll be there with you

Pumped Up Kicks - Robert's got a quick hand
He'll look around the room, he won't tell you his plan
He's got a rolled cigarette
Hanging out his mouth, he's a cowboy kid
Yeah, he found a six shooter gun
In his dad's closet with a box of fun things
I don't even know what
But he's coming for you, yeah, he's coming for you

Don't Stop Me Now - I'm a rocket ship on my way to Mars on a collision course
I am a satellite, I'm out of control
I'm a sex machine, ready to reload like an atom bomb
About to oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, explode
I'm burning through the sky, yeah
Two hundred degrees, that's why they call me Mister Fahrenheit
I'm travelling at the speed of light
I wanna make a supersonic woman of you

Welcome To The Black Parade - Sometimes, I get the feeling she's watching over me
And other times, I feel like I should go
And through it all, the rise and fall, the bodies in the streets
And when you're gone, we want you all to know
We'll carry on, we'll carry on
And though you're dead and gone, believe me
Your memory will carry on, we'll carry on
And in my heart, I can't contain it
The anthem won't explain it

Godzilla - Fill 'em with the venom and eliminate 'em
Other words, I Minute Maid 'em
I don't wanna hurt 'em, but I did, I'm in a fit of rage
I'm murdering again, nobody will evade
I'm finna kill 'em and dump all their fucking bodies in the lake
Obliterating everything, incinerate a renegade
I'm here to make anybody who want it with the pen afraid
But don't nobody want it, but they're gonna get it anyway
'Cause I'm beginning to feel like I'm mentally ill
I'm Attila, kill or be killed, I'm a killer bee, the vanilla gorilla
You're bringing the killer within me outta me
You don't wanna be the enemy of the demon who entered me
And be on the receiving end of me, what stupidity it'd be
Every bit of me's the epitome of a spitter
When I'm in the vicinity, motherfucker, you better duck
Or you finna be dead the minute you run into me
A hundred percent of you is a fifth of a percent of me
I'm about to fucking finish you, bitch, I'm unfadable
You wanna battle, I'm available, I'm blowing up like an inflatable
I'm undebatable, I'm unavoidable, I'm unevadable
I'm on the toilet bowl, I got a trailer full of money and I'm paid in full

Industry Baby - And this one is for the champions
I ain't lost since I began, yeah
Funny how you said it was the end, yeah
Then I went did it again, yeah
I told you long ago on the road
I got what they waiting for
I don't run from nothing, dog
Get your soldiers, tell 'em I ain't laying low
You was never really rooting for me anyway
When I'm back up at the top, I wanna hear you say
He don't run from nothing, dog
Get your soldiers, tell 'em that the break is over

Do I Wanna Know? - Crawling back to you
Ever thought of calling when
You've had a few?
'Cause I always do
Maybe I'm too
Busy being yours
To fall for somebody new
Now, I've thought it through

Blue Monday - I see a ship in the harbour
I can and shall obey
But, if it wasn't for your misfortune
I'd be a heavenly person today
And I thought I was mistaken
And I thought I heard you speak
Tell me, how do I feel?
Tell me now, how should I feel?
Now I stand here waiting

Best Of You - I've got another confession, my friend
I'm no fool
I'm getting tired of starting again
Somewhere new
Were you born to resist
Or be abused?
I swear I'll never give in
I refuse
Is someone getting the best
The best, the best, the best of you?

Nightcall - There's something inside you
It's hard to explain
They're talking about you, boy
But you're still the same

Black Hole Sun - In my eyes, indisposed
In disguises no one knows
Hides the face, lies the snake
In the sun in my disgrace
Boiling heat, summer stench
'Neath the black, the sky looks dead
Call my name through the cream
And I'll hear you scream again

The Less I Know The Better - Someone said they left together
I ran out the door to get her
She was holding hands with Trevor
Not the greatest feeling ever
Said, "Pull yourself together
You should try your luck with Heather"
Then I heard they slept together
Oh, the less I know the better

Tribute - And the peculiar thing is this, my friends
The song we sang on that fateful night
It didn't actually sound anything like this song
This is just a tribute
You've got to believe me
And I wish you were there
Just a matter of opinion
Ah, fuck!
Good God, gotta love it now
So surprised to find you can't stop it now
A fiery ring of fire
Rich motherfucker

Baby I'm Yours - Something tells me that I'm dreaming
I can see us there
Waving unaware
Of problems that have a tendency to keep
Keep the truth confined
Far from our minds
You need someone you can believe in
This I do declare
Trust me I'll be there
The road that leads to heaven can be so steep
I will help you climb
Change your state of mind

Davy's On The Road Again - Davy's on the road again
Wearin' different clothes again
Davy's turning handouts down
To keep his pockets clean
Sayin' his goodbyes again
Wheels are in his eyes again
Says, "If you see Jean, now
Ask her, please, to pity me"

Take Me Home, Country Roads - Almost Heaven, West Virginia
Blue Ridge Mountains, Shenandoah River
Life is old there, older than the trees
Younger than the mountains, growing like a breeze

Hit Me With Your Rhythm Stick - In the dock of Tiger Bay
On the road to Mandalay
From Bombay to Santa Fe
Over hills and far away

You Spin Me Round - I set my sights on you
And no one else will do
And I, I've got to have my way now, baby
All I know is that to me
You look like you're having fun
Open up your loving arms
Watch out, here I come

The Riddle - Near a tree by a river, there's a hole in the ground
Where an old man of Aran goes around and around
And his mind is a beacon in the veil of the night
For a strange kind of fashion, there's a wrong and a right
But he'll never, never fight over you

Wuthering Heights - Out on the wily, windy moors
We'd roll and fall in green
You had a temper like my jealousy
Too hot, too greedy
How could you leave me
When I needed to possess you?
I hated you, I loved you too

I Believe In A Thing Called Love - Can't explain all the feelings that you're making me feel
My heart's in overdrive and you're behind the steering wheel
Touching you
Touching me
Touching you, God, you're touching me

Teenage Dirtbag - And her boyfriend's a dick
And he brings a gun to school
And he'd simply kick
My ass if he knew the truth
He lives on my block
And he drives an IROC
But he doesn't know who I am
And he doesn't give a damn about me

Pretty Fly - You know, it's kinda hard just to get along today
Our subject isn't cool, but he fakes it anyway
He may not have a clue and he may not have style
But everything he lacks, well, he makes up in denial
So don't debate, a player straight
You know he really doesn't get it anyway
Gotta play the field, and keep it real
For you no way, for you no way
So if you don't rate, just overcompensate
At least that you'll know you can always go on Ricki Lake
The world needs wannabes, ah
Hey, hey, do that brand new thing!

The Bad Touch - Love, the kind you clean up with a mop and bucket
Like the lost catacombs of Egypt, only God knows where we stuck it
Hieroglyphics, let me be Pacific: I wanna be down in your South Seas
But I got this notion that the motion of your ocean means "Small Craft Advisory"
So, if I capsize on your thighs high tide, B five, you sunk my battleship
Please turn me on, I'm Mister Coffee with an automatic drip
So show me yours, I'll show you mine, "Tool Time," you'll Lovett just like Lyle
And then we'll do it doggy style so we can both watch "X Files"

Somebody That I Used To Know - But you didn't have to cut me off
Make out like it never happened and that we were nothing
And I don't even need your love
But you treat me like a stranger, and that feels so rough
No, you didn't have to stoop so low
Have your friends collect your records and then change your number
I guess that I don't need that though
Now you're just somebody that I used to know

Thrift Shop - Copping it, washing it, 'bout to go and get some compliments
Passing up on those moccasins someone else has been walking in
Bummy and grungy, fuck it man, I am stunting and flossing
And saving my money and I'm hella happy; that's a bargain, bitch
I'ma take your grandpa's style, I'ma take your grandpa's style
No, for real, ask your grandpa, can I have his hand me downs?
Velour jumpsuit and some house slippers
Dookie brown leather jacket that I found digging
They had a broken keyboard, I bought a broken keyboard
I bought a skeet blanket, then I bought a knee board
Hello, hello, my ace man, my mellow
John Wayne ain't got nothing on my fringe game, hell no
I could take some Pro Wings, make 'em cool, sell those
The sneaker heads would be like, "Ah, he got the Velcros"

Jump Around - Pack it up, pack it in, let me begin
I came to win, battle me, that's a sin
I won't ever slack up, punk, ya better back up
Try and play the role and yo, the whole crew'll act up
Get up, stand up, come on, throw your hands up
If ya got the feeling, jump up towards the ceiling
Muggs lets the funk flow, someone's talking junk
Yo, I bust him in the eye and then I'll take the punk's ho
Feeling, funking, amps in the trunk, and
I got more rhymes than there's cops at a Dunkin
Donuts shop, sho' nuff, I got props
From the kids on the Hill plus my mom and my pops
I came to get down, I came to get down
So get out your seat and jump around

Gangsta's Paradise - As I walk through the valley of the shadow of death
I take a look at my life and realize there's nothing left
'Cause I've been blasting and laughing so long, that
Even my momma thinks that my mind is gone
But I ain't never crossed a man that didn't deserve it
Me be treated like a punk, you know that's unheard of
You better watch how you talkin' and where you walking
Or you and your homies might be lined in chalk
I really hate to trip, but I gotta loc
As they croak, I see myself in the pistol smoke
Fool, I'm the kinda G the little homies wanna be like
On my knees in the night, sayin' prayers in the streetlight

Through The Fire And Flames - So now, we fly ever free, we're free before the thunderstorm
On towards the wilderness, our quest carries on
Far beyond the sundown, far beyond the moonlight
Deep inside our hearts and all our souls

Party Rock Anthem - In the club: Party rock
Looking for your girl? She on my jock
Nonstop when we in the spot
Booty moving weight like she on the block
Where the drank? I gots to know
Tight jeans, tattoo, 'cause I'm rock and roll
Half black, half white: domino
Gaining money, Oprah, dough
Yo! I'm running through these hoes like Drano
I got that devilish flow, rock and roll, no halo
We party rock!, yeah, that's the crew that I'm reppin'
On the rise to the top, no Led in our Zeppelin

Uptown Funk - This hit, that ice cold
Michelle Pfeiffer, that white gold
This one for them hood girls
Them good girls, straight masterpieces
Stylin', wilin', living it up in the city
Got Chucks on with Saint Laurent
Gotta kiss myself, I'm so pretty

Moves Like Jagger - Maybe it's hard, when you feel like
You're broken and scarred, nothing feels right
But when you're with me
I'll make you believe
That I've got the key
Oh, so get in the car, we can ride it
Wherever you want, get inside it
And you wanna steer, but I'm shifting gears
I'll take it from here

It's My Life - This ain't a song for the broken hearted
No silent prayer for the faith departed
I ain't gonna be just a face in the crowd
You're gonna hear my voice when I shout it out loud

Lonely Boy - Well, I'm so above you and it's plain to see
But I came to love you anyway
So you pulled my heart out and I don't mind bleeding
Any old time you keep me waiting
Waiting, waiting

Stolen Dance - And I want you
We can bring it on the floor
You've never danced like this before
We don't talk about it
Dancing on, do the boogie all night long
You're stoned in paradise
Shouldn't talk about it

I Will Survive - And so you're back, from outer space
I just walked in to find you here with that sad look upon your face
I should have changed that stupid lock
I should have made you leave your key
If I'd have known for just one second you'd be back to bother me
Go on now, go, walk out the door
Just turn around now, 'cause you're not welcome anymore
Weren't you the one who tried to hurt me with goodbye?
Did you think I'd crumble? Did you think I'd lay down and die?

In The End - It starts with one thing, I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind, I designed this rhyme
To explain in due time all I know
Time is a valuable thing
Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings
Watch it count down to the end of the day
The clock ticks life away, it's so unreal
Didn't look out below
Watch the time go right out the window
Trying to hold on, didn't even know
I wasted it all just to watch you go
I kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually be
A memory

What A Fool Believes - He came from somewhere back in her long ago
The sentimental fool don't see
Trying hard to recreate
What had yet to be created once in her life
She musters a smile for his nostalgic tale
Never coming near what he wanted to say
Only to realize it never really was

Scatman's World - Everybody's talking something very shocking
Just to keep on blocking what they're feeling inside
But listen to me, brother, you just keep on walking
'Cause you and me and sister ain't got nothing to hide
Scatman, fat man, black and white and brown man
Tell me about the color of your soul
If part of your solution isn't ending the pollution
Then I don't want to hear your stories told
I want to welcome you to Scatman's World

The Dock Of The Bay - I left my home in Georgia
Headed for the 'Frisco bay
'Cause I've had nothing to live for
And look like nothing's gonna come my way
So I'm just gonna sit on the dock of the bay
Watching the tide roll away
I'm sitting on the dock of the bay
Wasting time

Baggy Trousers - The headmaster's had enough today
All the kids have gone away
Gone to fight with next door's school
Every term that is the rule
Sits alone and bends his cane
Same old backsides again
All the small ones tell tall tales
Walking home and squashing snails
Oh what fun we had
But did it really turn out bad
All i learnt at school
Was how to bend not break the rules
Oh what fun we had
But at the time it seemed so bad
Trying different ways to
Make a difference to the days

Wild Wild West - Wild Wild West
Jim West, desperado
Rough rider, no you don't want nada
None of this, six gunning this, brother runnin this
Buffalo soldier, look it's like I told ya
Any damsel that's in distress
Be outta that dress when she meet Jim West
Rough neck so go check the law and abide
Watch your step or flex and get a hole in your side
Swallow your pride, don't let your lip react
You don't wanna see my hand where my hip be at
With Artemus, from the start of this, running the game
James West, taming the West, so remember the name

Space Jam - Party people in the house, lets go
It's your boy "Jay Ski", aight
So pass that thing and watch me flex
Behind my back, you know what's next
To the jam, all in your face
Wassup, just feel the bass
Drop it, rock it, down the room
Shake it, quake it, space; kaboom
Just work that body, work that body
Make sure you don't hurt nobody
Get wild and lose your mind
Take this thing into overtime
Hey DJ, turn it up
QCD gon' burn it up
C'mon, y'all get on the floor
So hey, let's go aight

X Gon' Give It To Ya - X gon' give it to ya
Fuck waitin' for you to get it on your own, X gon' deliver to ya
Knock knock, open up the door, it's real
With the nonstop pop pop from stainless steel
Go hard, gettin' busy with it
But I got such a good heart that I'll make a motherfucker wonder if he did it
Damn right, and I'll do it again
'Cause I am light so I gots to win
Break bread with the enemy
No matter how many cats I break bread with, I'll break who you sendin' me
You motherfuckers never wanted nothin' but your life saved
Bitch, and that's on a light day

Barbie Girl - I'm a blonde bimbo girl in a fantasy world
Dress me up, make me tight, I'm your dolly
You're my doll, rock and roll, feel the glamor in pink
Kiss me here, touch me there, hanky panky
You can touch, you can play
If you say I'm always yours

Dragostea Din Tei - Alo! Salut!
Sunt eu, un haiduc!
Și te rog, iubirea mea
Primește fericirea
Alo! Alo!
Sunt eu, Picasso!
Țiam dat beep, și sunt voinic
Dar să știi, nuți cer nimic
